# JSConf Argentina 2014 (Website)

Website for JSConf Argentina 2014. [See the live site](https://www.jsconfar.com).


![JSConfAr Site](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfar-2014/blob/master/assets/screenshot.png)


This site has multiple modules, including a lot of SVG and CSS animations, a custom terminal (with even more animations and effects), a real time ticketing system, a [real time dashboard system](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfar-2014-dashboard) integrated with the venue, and even a full-blown [multiplayer shooter game](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfar-2014-game) integrated into the site.

Every single component has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, using [io.js](https://iojs.org/) for the backend and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) for real time interactions.

The ticketing system couldn't be open sourced, since its heavily integrated with private payment APIs, but leaving the actual checkout aside, you can modify the most popular modules as you wish.
